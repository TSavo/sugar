"""The source tree: the class hierarchy IS the grammar.

``Node`` is the abstract base; ``Call``, ``FunctionDef``,
``Assert``, ``Name``, ... subclass it. Which fields exist is answered by
which class you hold — you cannot ask a non-Call for its args because you do
not have one. Arity lives in the field types (``Expression`` vs
``Expression | None`` vs ``tuple[Expression, ...]``). There is no
``NodeKind`` dispatch, no ``match`` on tags, no ASDL table.

``Typeable`` is the interface: "you may ask me for my type."
``Typed`` is the abstract class: "I have a resolved type, here it is."
The transition between them IS the construction event: a backend handle is
``Typeable`` (it can be asked to resolve, and panics as a MISSING if it
cannot); every constructed node is ``Typed`` by virtue of being an
instance of its concrete class. A ``Typeable`` that cannot resolve NEVER
becomes a quiet ``False`` or a bare ``None``.

Asking "which node is this" is ``isinstance`` on THESE classes — blessed
and encouraged (design review, #5940 section 6). What is banned is tag
dispatch on strings.

Equality is identity: each build constructs one node per site, so
``a is b`` is the sameness question within a ``SourceFile``. There is no
pool and no interning across files — structural equality across sources
is a CID question, answered by mementos, not by ``__eq__``.

Nodes carry their own fields; nothing is ever written onto a
backend node (no stamping). Synthetic nodes (a future ``assert_with_test``)
are ordinary instances of these classes with no backend handle at all —
the backend contract stays read-only.
